### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com)

I used Vite for this React project, and integrated SASS and PostCSS to get familiar with CSS processors. I learned how to build a filter with pagination using states and also improved my UI design skills.
